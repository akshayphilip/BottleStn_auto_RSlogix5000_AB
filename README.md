### **About the Project**

This project i have designed when i was doing Robotics and Industrial Automation(Co-op) at Conestoga college, the project task was to design a fully automated system, using allen bradley PLC , for create programme i have used RSlogix5000 and for the visal interface i have used factory talk view.

For this project i have divided the programming part into four stations, the first station refers to the walking beam, the 2nd part , it is the bottle filling station, the 3rd station is cap insert station and finally station is cap tighting station, for more details on station will provided below
