# BottleStn_auto_RSLogix5000_Allen_bradley

In this project i have fully automated a bottle filling station , using allen bradley plc , and for programming the ladder logic i have use the RSLogix5000, for the visual experience i have used factory talk view from the allen bradley

### **About the Project**

This project i have designed when i was doing Robotics and Industrial Automation(Co-op) at Conestoga college, the project task was to design a fully automated system, using allen bradley PLC , for create programme i have used RSlogix5000 and for the visal interface i have used factory talk view.

For this project i have divided the programming part into four stations, the first station refers to the walking beam, the 2nd part , it is the bottle filling station, the 3rd station is cap insert station and finally station is cap tighting station, for more details on station will provided below

### **Walking Beam(Station 1)**

In this station , used to move the beam horizontally according to the ladder logic, there is a clamp which helps to hold the bottle tight so that i make sure that bottle are holded at correct position and moved from one station to other properly, snap of the walking beam logic is provided below
